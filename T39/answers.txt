===Compulsory Task 1===

1. Protocol: A protocol is a defined structure of data for use in exchanges
between client and server. An example would be HTTP which uses a system of
client requests and server responses in a form of back and forth messaging
communications using proxy servers. Protocols set the rules for how these
are formatted in order to standardise communications.

2. HTTP is built on the TCP - IP protocol which breaks data in to "packets"
which are sent and reassembled on the recipients end.

3. Successful infomration receipt on HTTP would be represented by code 200.

4. A stateless protocol is one where the "state" isn't saved from the client
requests, there is no continuation from each request. E.g. repeatedly asking
for 1 request would not result in getting the next piece of data from a
database per request, instead it would repeatedly send the first piece of data.

5. b, c, f

6. An expected message to a denied access on a server could be 403 - forbidden
